# Test Scenarios

The deterministic engine has 45 automated regression cases, with 55 tests across the full suite. Last full run: July 19, 2026, all passing.

## Current D/S Cases

- September 15, 2030 cap plus the transition 60-day period.
- Earlier I-20 end date plus 60 days.
- Immediate old-rule answer before all document dates are known.
- Qualifying EAD later than the I-20, including the four-year cap.
- Ambiguous numeric date preserving a safe partial result.

## Fixed-Period Cases

- Four-year maximum measured from the I-20 start date, not physical entry.
- I-20 end earlier than the maximum.
- Actual I-94 date accepted without adding another 30 days.
- Separate extension planning and timely filing dates.
- Missing program start date produces a targeted question, not an invented deadline.
- Explicit month-name date normalization.
- Entry more than 30 days before program start.
- 24-month English-language-training and 12-month public-high-school limits.
- Change of status inside the United States.

## Contradiction and Travel Cases

- A pre-effective-date entry conflicting with a "not here on September 15" answer.
- Clarification when the student will leave before the rule begins.
- Post-rule return does not start a four-year clock from the return date.
- Pending I-539 with a return seeking a longer period.
- Automatic visa revalidation routes to confirmation.
- Travel while change of status is pending.

## OPT and STEM OPT Cases

- Qualifying post-completion OPT inside both deadlines.
- Filing after March 18, 2027.
- Filing after the transition departure period.
- Missing or expired STEM OPT EAD date.
- Approved EAD end plus 60 days.
- Partial I-20 answer preserved when an approved EAD date is missing.

## Academic, CPT, and Family Cases

- Graduate program-change ban and school-transfer exception shown separately.
- Undergraduate change during and after the first academic year.
- Later same- or lower-level program.
- No CPT timing question when the I-20 program end and protected activity end are the same date.
- CPT relevance appears when an earlier admission deadline can interrupt otherwise-valid CPT.
- Timely pre-deadline filing can continue already-authorized CPT for up to 240 days, never beyond the DSO-authorized CPT end date.
- Filing after the employment-authorized activity period ends does not automatically preserve CPT.
- F-2 dependents included in extension planning.
- Early completion, authorized withdrawal, and status violation periods.
- Extension process, current fee links, biometrics language, and no premium-processing promise.

## End-to-End Verification

- GPT-5.6 Luna structured story extraction, including initial entry versus later travel.
- GPT-5.6 Sol structured advisor report using a server-recomputed deterministic result.
- Desktop progressive interview, contradiction resolution, current-student travel comparison, and overview page.
- Mobile 390 x 844 layout with no horizontal overflow and a vertical timeline transformation.
- Production TypeScript and Vite build.
